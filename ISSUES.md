# Issues

### Symptom: Controller not visible in scene, no error messages
* Fix: Firmware update accessible from steam display

### Symptom: Vive controller trigger not producing action
* Fix: Ensure bindings include Trigger click -> squeeze

### Symptom: pupil_capture.exe has stopped working, immediately on startup

* Fix: Window restart (Ugh). Unplugging and re-plugging USB from eye trackers seems to work sometimes.
